  <h3>Prep Time</h3>
  <p>Probably like 10-20 minutes</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>2 sticks softened butter (1 cup)</li>
    <li>3/4 cup packed light brown sugar</li>
    <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>1 Tbsp vanilla</li>
    <li>3½ -4 cups flour (I live at about 5000 ft, and I like all my cookies with an extra ½ cup of flour. It makes them puffier. Thus the range.)</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
    <li>10 oz bag of chocolate chips</li>
    <li>1 package of Double Stuff Oreo Cookies</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Instructions</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees.</li>
    <li>Cream butter and sugars until well combined.</li>
    <li>Add eggs and vanilla until well combined.</li>
    <li>In a separate bowl, mix the flour, salt and baking soda.</li>
    <li>Slowly add dry ingredients to wet ingredients along with the chocolate chips until just combined.</li>
    <li>Using a cookie scoop or a spoon, place a scoop of dough on top of an Oreo Cookie. Now take another scoop of dough and place on the bottom of the Oreo Cookie. Seal edges together by pressing and cupping in hand until Oreo Cookie is enclosed in dough. Place onto a parchment or silpat lined baking sheet.</li>
    <li>Repeat until you run out of dough or Oreo's</li>
    <li>Bake cookies 9-13 minutes or until lightly browned. Let cool 5 minutes before transferring to cooling rack.</li>
    <li>Serve with a tall glass milk and enjoy!</li>
